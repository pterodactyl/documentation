Wings is the next generation server control plane from Pterodactyl. It has been rebuilt from the ground up using Go and lessons learned from our first Nodejs Daemon.

## Getting Started

If you're installing Wings for the first time, start with the [Installing Wings](/wings/installing) guide.

If you're migrating from the old Node.JS daemon (0.6.x), see the [Migrating to Wings](/wings/migrating) guide.
