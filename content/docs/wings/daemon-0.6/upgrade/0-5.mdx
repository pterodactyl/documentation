<Callout type="error" title="This Software is Abandoned">
This documentation is for **abandoned software** which does not receive any security updates or support
from the community. This documentation has been left accessible for historical reasons.

You should be installing and using [Wings](/wings/installing) in production environments with
[Pterodactyl Panel 1.0](/panel/getting-started).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Your servers will not go offline during this process thanks to Docker. Clients will briefly lose connection
to the Daemon from the Panel, but only during the restart phase.
</Callout>

## Download Newest Release

First, ensure you're in the Daemon directory, `/srv/daemon`, before continuing through this process. After you've done
that, run the command below to pull down the latest files and unpack them in the daemon directory.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pterodactyl/daemon/releases/download/v0.5.7/daemon.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xzv
```

## Update Components

After you've pulled down the latest files the last thing you need to do is run the commands below to update the
components and then restart the daemon.

```bash
npm update --only=production
systemctl restart wings
```
