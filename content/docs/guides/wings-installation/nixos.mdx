This guide provides instructions for installing Pterodactyl Wings on NixOS.

## Configuration

Make sure to firstly create the node on the panel in order to configure wings. To enable the service, add the following code to your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  services.pterodactyl.wings = {
    enable = true;
    uuid = "your-node-uuid";
    remote = "https://panel.example.com";
    # Using agenix, sops-nix or something else
    tokenIdFile = "/path/to/token_id";
    # Direct (not recommended)
    # tokenId = "";
    tokenFile = "/path/to/token";
    # tokenFile = "";
  };
}
```

If you want wings to be accessible to the public, make sure to open the API and SFTP ports by adding this in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  services.pterodactyl.wings = {
    openFirewall = true;
  };
}
```

### Opening container ports

Unfortunately this cannot be done automatically. If you have made a lot of ports as a range,
you can open them with `networking.firewall.allowedTCPPortRanges` and `networking.firewall.allowedUDPPortRanges` in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  networking.firewall = {
    enable = true;
    allowedTCPPortRanges = [
      { from = 25565; to = 25600; }
      { from = 3000; to = 3100; }
    ];
    allowedUDPPortRanges = [
      { from = 25565; to = 25600; }
      { from = 3000; to = 3100; }
    ];
  };
}
```
