# Updating the Panel
This documentation covers the process for updating within the `1.x` series of releases. This means updating from
&mdash; for example &mdash; `1.2.2` to `1.3.0`. **Do not use this guide for upgrading from `0.7`.**

## Panel Version Requirements
Each version of Pterodactyl Panel also has a corresponding minimum version of Wings that
is required for it to run. Please see the chart below for how these versions line up. In
most cases your base Wings version should match that of your Panel.

| Panel Version | Wings Version | Supported | PHP Versions |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1.0.x         | 1.0.x         |           | 7.3, 7.4     |
| 1.1.x         | 1.1.x         |           | 7.3, 7.4     |
| 1.2.x         | 1.2.x         |           | 7.3, 7.4     |
| 1.3.x         | 1.3.x         |           | 7.4, **8.0** |
| **1.4.x**     | **1.4.x**     | ✅        | 7.4, **8.0** |

## Update Dependencies
::: warning Minimum PHP Version Changed
If you are upgrading from a version of Pterodactyl _prior to_ `1.3.x` you'll need to update your PHP
dependencies. The latest versions of Pterodactyl Panel require a **minimum version of PHP 7.4** and
Composer v2.
:::

* PHP `7.4` or `8.0` (recommended)
* Composer `2.X`

Previous versions of Pterodactyl allowed for you to be running PHP 7.3. However, due to dependency updates and
the fact that 7.3 is now EOL we have bumped the minimum acceptable PHP version to 7.4 — PHP 8 is recommended. You
will also need to be using Composer v2.

**Before continuing**, please ensure that your system has been upgraded to at least PHP 7.4 by running `php -v`. You 
should see output similar to the output below. If you do not see at least PHP 7.4 you will need to upgrade by following
our [PHP Upgrade Guide](/guides/php_upgrade.md) and then return to this documentation.

```
vagrant@pterodactyl:~/app$ php -v
PHP 8.0.1 (cli) (built: Jan 13 2021 08:22:35) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.0.1, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v8.0.1, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
vagrant@pterodactyl:~/app$ composer --version
Composer version 2.0.8 2020-12-03 17:20:38
```

## Self Upgrade
If your version of Pterodactyl Panel is `1.3.2` or higher you can simply run the following command to perform a
self-upgrade of the Panel. This will download all of the necessary files and perform all of the actions listed
in this upgrade documentation.

```bash
cd /var/www/pterodactyl && php artisan p:upgrade
```

## Manual Upgrade
If you prefer not to perform the automatic self-upgrade, or need to reference any upgrade steps you can follow
the documentation below.

::: warning
If you've already performed the self-upgrade successfully you do not need to do anything else on this page.
:::

### Enter Maintenance Mode
Whenever you are performing an update you should be sure to place your Panel into maintenance mode. This will prevent
users from encountering unexpected errors and ensure everything can be updated before users encounter
potentially new features.

```bash
cd /var/www/pterodactyl

php artisan down
```

### Download the Update
The first step in the update process is to download the new panel files from GitHub. The command below will download
the release archive for the most recent version of Pterodactyl, save it in the current directory and will automatically
unpack the archive into your current folder.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | tar -xzv
```

Once all of the files are downloaded we need to set the correct permissions on the cache and storage directories to avoid
any webserver related errors.

```bash
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

### Update Dependencies
After you've downloaded all of the new files you will need to upgrade the core components of the panel. To do this,
simply run the commands below and follow any prompts.

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### Clear Compiled Template Cache
You'll also want to clear the compiled template cache to ensure that new and modified templates show up correctly for
users.

```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Database Updates
You'll also need to update your database schema for the newest version of Pterodactyl. Running the command below
will update the schema and ensure the default eggs we ship are up to date (and add any new ones we might have). Just
remember, _never edit core eggs we ship_! They will be overwritten by this update process.

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

### Set Permissions
The last step is to set the proper owner of the files to be the user that runs your webserver. In most cases this
is `www-data` but can vary from system to system &mdash; sometimes being `nginx`, `caddy`, `apache`, or even `nobody`.

```bash
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pterodactyl/*

# If using NGINX on CentOS:
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pterodactyl/*

# If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pterodactyl/*
```

### Restarting Queue Workers
After _every_ update you should restart the queue worker to ensure that the new code is loaded in and used.

```bash
php artisan queue:restart
```

### Exit Maintenance Mode
Now that everything has been updated you need to exit maintenance mode so that the Panel can resume accepting
connections.

```bash
php artisan up
```
