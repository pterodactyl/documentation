# Webserver Configuration

::: warning
When using the SSL configuration you MUST create SSL certificates, otherwise your webserver will fail to start. See the [Creating SSL Certificates](/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html) documentation page to learn how to create these certificates before continuing.

First, remove the default NGINX configuration.

``` bash
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Now, you should paste the contents of the file below, replacing `<domain>` with your domain name being used in a file called
`pterodactyl.conf` and place the file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`, or &mdash; if on CentOS, `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

<<< @/.snippets/webservers/nginx-php8.1.conf{5,11,26-27}

### Enabling Configuration

The final step is to enable your NGINX configuration and restart it.

```bash
# You do not need to symlink this file if you are using CentOS.
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf

# You need to restart nginx regardless of OS.
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Enabling Configuration

The final step is to enable your NGINX configuration and restart it.

```bash
# You do not need to symlink this file if you are using CentOS.
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf

# You need to restart nginx regardless of OS.
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

::: tab "Apache With SSL"
First, remove the default Apache configuration.

``` bash
a2dissite 000-default.conf
```

Now, you should paste the contents of the file below, replacing `<domain>` with your domain name being used in a file called
`pterodactyl.conf` and place the file in `/etc/apache2/sites-available`, or &mdash; if on CentOS, `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`.

Note: When using Apache, make sure you have the `libapache2-mod-php` package installed or else PHP will not display on your webserver.

<<< @/.snippets/webservers/apache.conf{2,10,24-25}

### Enabling Configuration

Once you've created the file above, simply run the commands below. If you are on CentOS _you do not need to run the commands
below!_ You only need to run `systemctl restart httpd`.

```bash
# You do not need to run any of these commands on CentOS
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
