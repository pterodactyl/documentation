# Ubuntu 20.04
In this guide we will install Pterodactyl v1.X — including all of it's dependencies — and configure our webserver to serve it using SSL.

::: tip
This guide is based off the [official installation documentation](/panel/1.0/getting_started.md) but is tailored specifically for Ubuntu 20.04.
:::

## Install Requirements
We will first begin by installing all of Pterodactyl's [required](/panel/1.0/getting_started.md#dependencies) dependencies.

### MariaDB
```bash
## Get apt updates
apt update -y

## Install MariaDB
apt install -y mariadb-common mariadb-server mariadb-client

## Start MariaDB
systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb
```

### PHP 8.0
```bash
## Get apt updates
apt update -y

## Install PHP 8.0
apt -y install php8.0 php8.0-{cli,gd,mysql,pdo,mbstring,tokenizer,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip}
```

### Nginx

```bash
apt install -y nginx
```

### Redis

```bash
apt install -y redis-server

systemctl start redis-server
systemctl enable redis-server
```

### Additional Utilities

#### Certbot
```bash
apt install -y certbot
```

#### Composer
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

## Server Configuration
This following section covers the configuration of parts of the server to run the panel.

### Configuring MariaDB
The fastest way to set up MariaDB is to use the `mysql_secure_installation` command and follow prompts

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

The following are safe defaults.

Change to your own secure password  
`Set root password? [Y/n] Y`

Get rid of users that could access the db by default  
`Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y`

Keep root off the external interfaces  
`Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y`

Extra databases that aren't needed  
`Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y`

Clears and sets all the changes made  
`Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y`

All done! If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB installation should now be secure.

#### Adding MariaDB user
To add your first user to the database, see our tutorial on [setting up MySQL](/tutorials/mysql_setup.md).

### Setup PHP
The default php-fpm configuration is fine to use and can be started and then enabled on the system using the
commands below.

```bash
systemctl enable php8.0-fpm
systemctl start php8.0-fpm
```

### Nginx Configuration
Follow [this guide](/panel/1.0/webserver_configuration.html) to setup Nginx for Pterodactyl, choose whether to use Nginx with or without SSL.

### Redis Setup
The default Redis install is perfectly fine for the panel. If you have Redis already in use you may want to look into
[running another Redis instance](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-setup-and-run-multiple-Redis-server-instances-on-a-Linux-host).

## Installing the Panel
Excellent, we now have all of the required dependencies installed and configured. From here, follow the [official Panel installation documentation](/panel/1.0/getting_started.md#download-files).
