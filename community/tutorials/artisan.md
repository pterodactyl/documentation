# Artisan CLI

The Artisan CLI, command line interface, is part of the Laravel framework, which Pterodactyl is built on. The Artisan file is located in `/var/www/pterodactyl` if you followed the official guide. This guide goes over some more Pterodactyl specific/related Artisan commands, which are all prefixed with the letter `p` (e.g. `p:user:make`). If you'd like to view all commands, you can do so by running:

```bash
php artisan list
```

To get information regarding a specific command you can do so by running:

```bash
php artisan help <command>
```

::: tip
To simplify this documentation, in command usage you'll see things like the following:

`<hello-world>` - Required argument

`[hello-world]` - Optional argument

`{--hello-world}` - Option

## User Management

When running any of the following commands, you can either use the options or don't pass through anything and use the interactive prompt. You can also do both passing through options and using interactive prompts as well.

### Create User

```bash
php artisan p:user:make {--email=user@example.com}
                        {--username=myusername}
                        {--name-first=My}
                        {--name-last=Name}
                        {--password=supersecret}
                        {--admin=1|0}
                        {--no-password}
```

### Delete User

```bash
php artisan p:user:delete {--user=username/email/UUID}
```

### Disable 2FA

::: warning
Disabling 2-factor authentication should only be used as a last restort for user recovery. **Please use this with caution.**
:::

```bash
php artisan p:user:disable2fa {--email=user@example.com}
```

## Server & Node Management
