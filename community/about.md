# Community Guides and Tutorials

## About
This section of Pterodactyl's site is dedicated to more complex topics, tutorials, and features that we
feel are important to share with the community, but do not fit into the theme of our core documentation.

Here you'll find in-depth OS-specific installation guides, advanced network configurations, individual game
setup instructions, and so much more.
